# Distribution of Dinosaur Fossils

This is a project made for the Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Visualisation course from the Artificial Intelligence and Data Science Especialization Course (UFES).

We analyse the data about fossils and their temporal and geographical distribution. For the conclusion, we create maps that help us understand which dinosaurs lived in each area at the same time.

All the maps and graphs are generated using Python.
